# VC-PL-VQVAE
Acronym for: Voice Conversion (VC) Perception-Aware Loss (PL) Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE).

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This is a research project that aims to enhance voice conversion techniques by integrating hierarchical VQVAE architectures with perception-aware loss functions. The model is designed to improve speech generation quality significantly, providing more natural and intelligible outputs.

### ðŸ“„ Current Status
The project is currently under review, and the corresponding research paper has not been published. The code will be made available after the review process.

### ðŸ”§ Tools and Technologies
- **Python**  
- **PyTorch & PyTorch-lightning**  
- **TorchAudio**  
- **Librosa**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Tensorboard**  
- **YAML for configuration**
